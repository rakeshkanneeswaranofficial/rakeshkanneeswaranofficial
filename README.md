# Appreciation & Awards



### üèÜ Secured 1st position in Pentathon 2024

####  Organised Next Gen AI And Bajaj Finserv Limited 
My project RaidexAI integrates Roboflow to detect anomalies such as brain tumors, Alzheimer's, kidney tumors, and ACL injuries, providing coordinates of the detected anomalies.

Subsequently, the output is transmitted to a Flask server where OpenCV is employed to create the Region of Interest (ROI) in the image.

The modified image is then relayed back to the React app. Additionally, the Flask server utilizes a Language Model (LLM) to perform contextual analysis of the image, interpreting its content alongside the detected anomalies.

  ### üèÜ Secured 1st position in OS Hack 2023

####  Issued by Department of Computing Technologies, School of Computing

Developed a AI chatbot for document quires with Google Palm model and Langchain.


 ### üèÜ Secured 1st place in Appthon 2023 


 #### Issued by Department of Computational Intelligence SRM Institute of Science and Technology and HCL Technologies Limited 

Developed an advanced multi-layered security system using computer vision and cloud computing, integrating on-device machine learning for authentication.

### üèÜ Winners at the National Level Project Exhibition, "The Idea Explorer 2023"

####  Issued by Department of Computer Science and Engineering with specialisation in Big Data Analytics at SRM Institute of Science and Technology

Developed an Artificial Intelligence Model ingergrated with Microsdt LIDA and deployed it in Google Cloud Platform. 

This application helps automatially generate visualizations and infographics with LLMs.
