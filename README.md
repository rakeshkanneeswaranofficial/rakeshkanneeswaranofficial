# Appreciation & Awards



### üèÜ Secured 1st position in Pentathon 2024

####  Organised Next Gen AI And Bajaj Finserv Limited 
My project RaidexAI integrates Roboflow to detect anomalies such as brain tumors, Alzheimer's, kidney tumors, and ACL injuries, providing coordinates of the detected anomalies.

Subsequently, the output is transmitted to a Flask server where OpenCV is employed to create the Region of Interest (ROI) in the image.

The modified image is then relayed back to the React app. Additionally, the Flask server utilizes a Language Model (LLM) to perform contextual analysis of the image, interpreting its content alongside the detected anomalies.
